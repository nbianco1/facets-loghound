  1. What the hell?

  Yes - it's another !JavaScript thingy.  But this one might actually be very helpful.  Log Hound wasn't designed in absentia of any driving need.  On the contrary, I developed this little utility while wading my way through over a thousand lines of combined ECMAscript, !JQuery, and Microsoft !JScript being used solely on IE 7 and 8.  If that doesn't scare a developer into wanting to find a better way to debug, then I don't know what would.

  2. Why???

  Firebug really isn't an option for JavaScript problems in IE.  If your first thought-reaction to that is "Why not just use IE Web Developer Toolbar", then you haven't used WDT on large complicated JavaScript projects.  If you have, then I sincerely hope you are getting paid more than me.
