This page lists the public functions you may use to manage how Log Hound functions.
----
=== log() ===
{{{log({String}msg, {Array}tags, {Error}errorObject, {LogHoundLevel}logLevel)}}}
  * logLevel [required]: The log level of the message.
  * msg [required]: The message to log.
  * tags: String tags to associate with the log message.
  * errorObject: An error object to display with the message.

*Note:* The order of the arguments does not matter.  Log Hound detects the argument types and handles them as appropriate.
  

There are two ways to log messages.  You can either use the log[Level]() functions which delegate to the log() function, or you can use the log() function directly:

{{{
window.logHound.log(LogHoundLevels['FATAL'],'Fatal: If you see this, your app is toast.',['Tag1','AllTags'],errObj);
}}}

You can always use the level-specific log functions which do not need the LogHoundLevel argument. The following is exactly the same as the previous example:

{{{
window.logHound.logFatal('Fatal: If you see this, your app is toast.',['Tag1','AllTags'],errObj);
}}}
