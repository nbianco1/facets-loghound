===Log Messages===
Log Hound is a !JavaScript logger.  This is to say that you can have lines like this in your code:
{{{
window.logHound.logInfo('Info: FYI...');
}}}
...and you get a log message in the Log Hound interface like this:

Out of the box, Log Hound supports your six basic logging levels: Fatal, Error, Warn, Info, Debug, and Trace.

----
===Define Your Own Log Levels===
You can easily define your own log levels to Log Hound.  As an example, here's how the Trace log level is defined:

{{{
function PageLogHoundLevel() {
    TraceLogHoundLevel.baseConstructor.call(this, 40, 'page', true);
}
var LogHoundLevelPreload = new Array();
LogHoundLevelPreload[0] = PageLogHoundLevel;
}}}

The important parts are to give your log level function a unique name and to be sure to include the base constructor line.  For the base constructor line:
 * 'this' = don't change this.
 * '50' = this is the integer level weight of the log message and should reflect the position the message would represent.  Trace is 50 and Fatal is 100, the intervening levels occupying the multiples of ten.  If your message is more detailed than Trace (really???), then set it at a lower number than 50.  You get the idea.
 * 'trace' = the string name of the level.  Alpha characters only.  Must be unique.
 * 'true' = Whether or not the level is enabled.  This is used internally, but can be used to initially disable a logging level until it is turned on in the interface. Keep this as "true" unless you know what you are doing.

----
===Message Tags===
Logged messages can be tagged.  Tags allow you to manipulate and search through the log messages in new and unique ways.  Tags are applied by adding an array argument to the log method call:

{{{
window.logHound.logInfo('Info: FYI...',['Tag3','AllTags']);
}}}

In this case the tags for the message are "Tag3" and "!AllTags".  Other tags you could add to a message are: 
 # the name of the function the message is logged in
 # the name of the script the message is from

Tags can be utilized by the Log Hound interface with the tag controls:
